# WNDW.app - Designed to take the pain out of presenting your ultrawide monitor

If you have an ultra-wide or super ultra wide monitor like me you know that sharing screen can be a pain.

Make Google Meet, Slack, Zoom and Discord simple. Using the 'share window' feature, with WNDW you can show just part of your screen.

It's check out [WNDW.app](https://wndw.app) for a demonstration & branding.

If you're at this repo you want to build it yourself or read the source code to make sure it's all above board - Thats fine, to build it yourself...

With Node.js version 16.13.1 installed and your terminal at the root:

Install npm packages:
`npm i`

Build the app:
`npm run make`

The app should appear built for you in the `./out` directory.
